A.k.a., what are we even trying to solve, and why?

Say you take a picture one day that you like, perhaps this one

You’d like to publish it somewhere online, but [for some reason](https://www.nivati.com/blog/neuroscience-what-social-media-does-to-your-brain) you want to avoid social media. It would be great if you had a simple page for this, almost a portfolio of sorts. Something with as little friction as possible.

And that’s the vision: a web application that on the outside shows a bunch of your pictures in a minimalistic interface, something like this:

Clicking a thumbnail opens the full picture.

Dragging a photo on one of the squares uploads it there.

The whole thing is hosted on a URL like `twentyfive.by/matej`

And that’s it! All of the other bells and whistles are completely optional!

Now, are there any other reasons to build this?
