Welcome to this blog! It started out in December 2024 as a way to write technically about a pet project to sharpen some of my skills.

## About me

[This is me](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vektor/), I’ve been doing software development professionally for almost 2 decades now, and as a hobby since I was a kid.

My current affiliation: I am the CTO in Realpad.

My past affiliations:

- I tried (and abandoned) a PhD at SAPE at USI Lugano, Switzerland.
- I worked as a software engineer at OKsystem.
- I studied computer science (focusing on databases) at Charles University, Prague.
- I went to GAMČA in Bratislava, Slovakia.

## About the project

It’s the simplest possible photo-sharing SaaS thing out there that still exhibits the richness of challenges I intend to tackle. Or I don’t know, perhaps there is something like that - I will not spoil the fun by finding out it’s somewhere on Github already!

## About this blog

As of writing these lines it’s not yet sure where this will be hosted. I promised myself not to start looking for a hosting before I have 10 blog posts ready!
